      Hi, I'm Vignesh, and I'm learning to make cool websites. I know how to make them look nice and work well using stuff like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also tried building the parts that work behind the scenes with things like Node.js and MongoDB. I've practiced by working on school projects to get better at this. Besides coding, I really enjoy making things look pretty, like designing graphics. I'm excited to meet others who like tech and maybe work on fun projects together. Thanks for checking out my website where I'll share my coding and design adventures with you!
